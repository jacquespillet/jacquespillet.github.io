# Hi

## Welcome to my corner of the internet! 

I'm Jacques, a software developper originally from Marseille, France. 

My journey took me across the Channel to the bustling creative scene of London, where I honed my craft at [ScanLAB Projects](https://scanlabprojects.co.uk/) and now, I'm back in Marseille, and still working for ScanLAB.

Here, you'll find a showcase of what I've been up to on my spare time.

Feel free to explore, get inspired, and drop me a line if you fancy a chat. 

Thanks for stopping by!
