Over the years, ScanLAB has collaborated with the Sir John Soane’s Museum to create Explore Soane, an interactive website that allows visitors to explore detailed 3D scans of the museum’s rooms directly in their web browser.

I was involved in the last two additions - the Picture Room and the Drawing Office.

Working alongside a web developer, my main responsibility was to build the 3D rendering backend, implementing custom shaders and rendering techniques to reproduce ScanLAB’s signature aesthetic in real time, even on lower-end mobile devices.

Technologies : TypeScript, Three.js, WebGL, glsl

Here are a few shots of the content :
