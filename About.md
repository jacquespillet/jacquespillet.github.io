I'm Jacques Pillet, born in Switzerland, raised in France, and now living in the UK.

I'm currently working at [ScanLAB Projects](https://scanlabprojects.co.uk/), an award winning creative studio based in London.

I help them developping all the in-house tools they use to produce films and xr experiences (offline / realtime renderer, point cloud capture and processing...)

I have deep interests in computer graphics and more broadly software engineering.

On that website you can find all the stuff I've been working on in the past years on my spare time.
