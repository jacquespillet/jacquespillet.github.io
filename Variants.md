ScanLAB was commissioned by French artist Pierre Huyghe to contribute to Variants, a large-scale multidisciplinary project that included a screen-based installation.

My role was to develop a real-time point cloud rendering system capable of displaying data ranging from the vast scale of an entire island down to the microscopic detail of pine needles - all rendered with the distinct visual quality characteristic of ScanLAB’s work.

The resulting visuals were presented on a 10-meter-wide outdoor LED screen, delivering an immersive experience that blended art and technology.

This project was developed in close collaboration with Pierre Huyghe’s technical teams.

Technologies: Unity, C#, HLSL shaders
