Over the past few years, ScanLAB has been producing [Framerate](https://scanlabprojects.co.uk/projects/pulse-of-the-earth/) — a series of installations exhibited worldwide (SXSW, Venice Biennale, COP26, BFI London, PHI Centre, and more).

From ScanLAB’s description:

“FRAMERATE: Pulse of the Earth’s hypnotic imagery bears witness to landscapes in flux. The impact of human behaviour and the immense force of nature unfolds around you across an array of screens. This is a space where your perspective may shift.”

The installation features an array of synchronized screens displaying high-resolution point cloud timelapses that reveal both natural and human-driven transformations across landscapes.

To support this, I engineered a robust playback infrastructure and a suite of custom video players capable of maintaining frame-perfect synchronization across multiple machines and displays. The system was designed for long-term, unattended operation — ensuring precise timing, resilience to network fluctuations, and consistent performance over months-long exhibitions.

This playback system has since become a core component of all Framerate installations, enabling seamless, high-fidelity presentation of ScanLAB’s visual works.

It was recently deployed at an unprecedented scale for the Desert Pulse exhibit at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, AZ, where it will run for a full year.

Technologies used : c++, python, Qt, ffmpeg
