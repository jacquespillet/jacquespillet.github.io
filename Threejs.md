###  ThreeJS Experiments

These are all random micro experiments I've been playing with over the past years in no particular order.

Nothing is optimized in there, some might take some time to load due to assets.


## [Simple Cell Shading](Threejs/CellShading/CellShading.html)

## [Charcoal Pen](Threejs/Charcoal/Index.html) : 

Attempt to recreate the look of charcoal pen drawings.

## [Flow](Threejs/Flow2D/Index.html)

Combination of Fractal Brownian Motion and Gerstner waves.

## [Fluid surface](Threejs/Fluid/index.html)


## [Cloth](Threejs/Cloth/index.html)

## [Hair](Threejs/Hair/Index.html)

Hair simulated with a [position based solver](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-319-08234-9_92-1).

The colors are accumulated on the screen.

## [Particles](Threejs/Instances/Index.html)

Just a lot of cubes flowing in the air

## [Modifiers](Threejs/Modifiers/Index.html)

Experiments on procedurally changing shapes in the vertex shader

## [Cubes](Threejs/Music/Index.html)

???????

## [Volume](Threejs/Volume/Index.html)

a cloud inside a mesh ?  Does not really work
