# LIve Action

Several projects at ScanLAB explored real-time volumetric point cloud capture using depth sensors such as the Azure Kinect and Intel RealSense. These captured performances were then integrated into our visuals to create expressive, animated 3D scenes.

I developed a custom 3D capture system capable of recording volumetric data from multiple devices simultaneously, aligning and merging their feeds into coherent, high-frame-rate animated point clouds. The result was a flexible, high-fidelity capture pipeline that became a key part of ScanLAB’s creative toolkit.

This technology was used in two major productions:

Adult Children - an immersive theatre piece by the Donmar Warehouse, fully captured using our volumetric system.

Pistol - the TV series directed by Danny Boyle, for which we captured hundreds of individual dancers to create the final sequence. The shot transitions from traditional cinematography into our point-cloud aesthetic, closing the series with a striking visual signature.

Technologies: C++, OpenGL, Azure Kinect, Intel RealSense

Here are some visuals from those captures:
