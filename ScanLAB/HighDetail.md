# High Detail

For the last Framerate iteration, ScanLAB captured timelapse photogrammetry of cacti, documenting their subtle growth and movement over time.

This involved designing and operating two fully automated photogrammetry rigs capable of running continuously for weeks - even months in some cases - to capture images and generate 3D models with exceptional temporal detail.

The result produced some of the most visually striking and intricate imagery ScanLAB has ever created, in my opinion.

To handle the heavy processing workflow, I containerized our custom photogrammetry timelapse pipeline, enabling it to run seamlessly across local machines and remote servers. This made it easy to scale compute resources up or down depending on production needs.

Technologies: C++, Python, Docker

Here are a some visuals from these high-detail timelapses :
